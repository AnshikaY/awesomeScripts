On running this script, a person is first required to give input through speech and then output will be the first two sentences of the search result as given on Wikipedia.
This makes use of 'pyttsx3' and 'speech_recognition' for the purpose of taking input and providing output in speech format and 'wikipedia' library for the scraping. 'sys' library has been used for the sole purpose of termination of the program.
